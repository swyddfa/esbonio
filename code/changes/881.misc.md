**IMPORTANT!**

The VSCode extension will no longer automatically inject the currently active Python interpreter into the configuration sent to the server.
It is now required for all users to set the `esbonio.sphinx.pythonCommand` option, either in your VSCode settings, or in your project's `pyproject.toml` file.

This makes VSCode's behavior more predicable and brings it in line with how other editors behave.
It also encourages the sharing of project configuration settings, which is particuarly useful if you use an [environment manager](https://docs.esbon.io/en/latest/lsp/howto/use-esbonio-with.html)
