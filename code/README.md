# Esbonio ![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/swyddfa.esbonio?style=flat-square)

**This extension is in early development**

Esbonio is an extension that provides a language server for working with
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation projects.

## Setup

The language server works by wrapping an instance of Sphinx's application object,
inspecting it and exposing the results over the Language Service Protocol. As Sphinx is
a Python application this also dictates thats the Language Server is written in Python
and distributed as a package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/esbonio/).

In order to correctly wrap your Sphinx application this requires the Language Server be
installed into the same environment as the one that you use to build your
documentation.

There are a number of ways this can be accomplished.

### Automatically

The extension does its best to automate the installation and application of updates to the
Language Server. By default Esbonio will use the Python environment you have configured
[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
when installing and running the server. If however, you don't have the Python extension
installed or you want to use a different Python environment for your documentation there
is a configuration option `esbonio.pythonPath` that you can use to configure the
environment.

There are a number of configuration options that allow you to control exactly how
installation and updates are handled. See the
[documentation](https://swyddfa.github.io/esbonio/docs/lsp/editors/vscode.html#configuration)
for more details.

### Manually

Alternatively you can opt to manage the installation of the language server entirely
yourself. To install the Lanaguage Server open the terminal in your desired Python
environment and run

```
(env) $ pip install esbonio[lsp]
```

Then all you have to ensure is that Esbonio is configured to use the same environment,
either through the
[Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
or through the `esbonio.pythonPath` configuration option.

To also manage updates manually, be sure to look at the
[documentation](https://swyddfa.github.io/esbonio/docs/lsp/editors/vscode.html#configuration)
for options on how to disable automatic updates.

## Features

### Completions

The language server can provide completion suggestions in various contexts
#### Directives

Completion suggestions are offered for the directives themselves, as well as any options
that they expose.

#### Roles

In the case of roles, completions can also be offered for the targets of certain
[supported](https://swyddfa.github.io/esbonio/docs/lsp/features.html#roles) role types

#### Inter Sphinx

The [intersphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html)
extension can be used to easily link to other Sphinx projects. If configured, the language
server will offer suggestions when appropriate

### Diagnostics

Errors from a build are published to VSCode as diagnostics

### Syntax Highlighting

This extension also offers a simple grammar definition to enable some basic
syntax highlighting
