.. rubric:: esbonio -- (v.) to explain

Esbonio aims to make it easier to work with `reStructuredText`_ tools such as
`Sphinx`_ by providing a `Language Server`_ to enhance your editing experience.

Language Server
---------------

Here is a quick summary of the features implemented by the language server.

.. collection:: features

   .. collection-item:: Completion

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/completion` and can
      offer suggestions in a variety of contexts.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/completion-demo.gif
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/completion-demo.gif

   .. collection-item:: Definition

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/definition` to provide the
      location of items referenced by certain roles. Currently only the ``:ref:``
      and ``:doc:`` roles are supported.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/definition-demo.gif
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/definition-demo.gif

   .. collection-item:: Diagnostics

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/publishDiagnostics` to
      report errors/warnings enountered during a build.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/diagnostic-sphinx-errors-demo.png
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/diagnostic-sphinx-errors-demo.png

   .. collection-item:: Document Links

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/documentLink` to make references to other files "Ctrl + Clickable"

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/document-links-demo.png
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/document-links-demo.png

   .. collection-item:: Document Symbols

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/documentSymbol` which
      powers features like the "Outline" view in VSCode.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/document-symbols-demo.png
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/document-symbols-demo.png

   .. collection-item:: Hover

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/hover` to provide easy access to documentation for roles and directives.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/hover-demo.png
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/hover-demo.png

   .. collection-item:: Implementation

      The language server implements :lsp:`textDocument/implementation` so you can easily find the implementation of a given role or directive.

      .. figure:: ../resources/images/implementation-demo.gif
         :align: center
         :target: /_images/implementation-demo.gif
