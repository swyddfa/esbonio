v0.16.5 - 2024-09-23
--------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- Changed the preview server to use a Thread instead of a Process to prevent deadlocks on certain systems by @Nitorac (`#790 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/790>`_)


Misc
^^^^

- Pin pygls ``<2`` (`#898 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/898>`_)


v0.16.4 - 2024-01-11
--------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- Fix ``ValueError`` thrown when the server is given invalid ``Position`` data.
  Invalid values will be clamped to the range permitted by the language server protocol (``[0, 2147483647]``) (`#714 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/714>`_)


v0.16.3 - 2023-11-27
--------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- Fix ``ValueError`` thrown when building the document symbol for a title node that only contains a role. (`#685 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/685>`_)


v0.16.2 - 2023-10-07
--------------------

Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When creating a Sphinx application instance, the language server will now look in all workspace folders choosing the first valid configuration it finds.
  Failing that it will revert to its original behavior of looking in the ``workspaceRoot`` given by the client. (`#467 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/467>`_)


Fixes
^^^^^

- The server will no longer fail to handle the ``initialize`` request when clients set ``initializationOptions`` to ``null`` (`#586 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/586>`_)


Misc
^^^^

- Replace ``appdirs`` with ``platformdirs`` by @coloursofnoise (`#621 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/621>`_)


v0.16.1 - 2023-02-18
--------------------

Fixes
^^^^^

- With live previews enabled, ``esbonio`` should no longer conflict with Sphinx extensions that register their own ``source-read`` handlers. (`#539 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/539>`_)


v0.16.0 - 2023-02-04
--------------------

Features
^^^^^^^^

- Add new ``server.completion.preferredInsertBehavior`` option.
  This allows the user to indicate to the server how they would prefer completions to behave when accepted.

  The default value is ``replace`` and corresponds to the server's current behavior where completions replace existing text.
  In this mode the server will set the ``textEdit`` field of a ``CompletionItem``.

  This release also introduces a new mode ``insert``, where completions will append to existing text rather than replacing it.
  This also means that only the completions that are compatible with any existing text will be returned.
  In this mode the server will set the ``insertText`` field of a ``CompletionItem`` which should work better with editors that do no support ``textEdits``.

  **Note:** This option is only a hint and the server will not ensure that it is followed, though it is planned for all first party completion suggestions to (eventually) respect this setting.
  As of this release, all completion suggestions support ``replace``  and role, directive and directive option completions support ``insert``. (`#471 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/471>`_)


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Add getting started guide for Sublime Text by @vkhitrin (`#522 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/522>`_)


API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``CompletionContext`` objects now expose a ``config`` field that contains any user supplied configuration values affecting completions. (`#531 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/531>`_)


Misc
^^^^

- Drop Python 3.6 support (`#400 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/400>`_)
- Migrate to pygls ``v1.0``

  There are some breaking changes, but only if you use Esbonio's extension APIs, if you simply use the language server in your favourite editor you *shouldn't* notice a difference.

  The most notable change is the replacement of ``pydantic`` type definitions with ``attrs`` and ``cattrs`` via the new `lsprotocol <https://github.com/microsoft/lsprotocol>`__ package.
  For more details see pygls' `migration guide <https://pygls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/migrating-to-v1.html>`__. (`#484 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/484>`_)
- Drop support for Sphinx 3.x

  Add support for Sphinx 6.x (`#523 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/523>`_)


v0.15.0 - 2022-12-03
--------------------

Features
^^^^^^^^

- Add initial support for synced scrolling and live previews of HTML builds.
  **Note** Both of these features rely on additional integrations outside of the LSP protocol therefore requiring dedicated support from clients.

  Synced scrolling support can be enabled by setting the ``server.enableScrollSync`` initialization option to ``True`` and works by injecting line numbers into the generated HTML which a client can use to align the preview window to the source window.

  Live preview support can be enabled by setting the ``server.enableLivePreview`` initialization option to ``True``, the language server will then pass the contents of unsaved files for Sphinx to build.
  Currently clients are responsible for triggering intermediate builds with the new ``esbonio.server.build`` command, though this requirement may be removed in future. (`#490 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/490>`_)


Enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Completion suggestions will now also be generated for the long form (``:py:func:``) of roles and directives in the primary and standard Sphinx domains. (`#416 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/416>`_)
- The language server should now populate the ``serverInfo`` fields of its response to a client's ``initialize`` request. (`#497 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/497>`_)
- The default ``suggest_options`` implementation for ``DirectiveLanguageFeatures`` should now be more useful in that it will return the keys from a directive's ``option_spec`` (`#498 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/498>`_)
- The language server now recognises and returns ``DocumentLinks`` for ``image::`` and ``figure::`` directives that use ``http://`` or ``https://`` references for images. (`#506 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/506>`_)


Fixes
^^^^^

- Fix handling of deprecation warnings in Python 3.11 (`#494 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/494>`_)
- The language server should now correctly handle errors that occur while generating completion suggestions for a directive's options

  The language server should now show hovers for directives in the primary domain. (`#498 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/498>`_)
- Errors thrown by ``DirectiveLanguageFeatures`` during ``textDocument/documentLink`` or ``textDocument/definition`` requests are now caught and no longer result in frustrating error banners in clients.

  The ``textDocument/documentLink`` handler for ``image::`` and ``figure::`` should no longer throw exceptions for invalid paths on Windows. (`#506 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/506>`_)


API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``RoleLanguageFeatures`` have been introduced as the preferred method of extending role support going forward.
  Subclasses can be implement any of the following methods

  - ``complete_targets`` called when generating role target completion items
  - ``find_target_definitions`` used to implement goto definition for role targets
  - ``get_implementation`` used to get the implementation of a role given its name
  - ``index_roles`` used to tell the language server which roles exist
  - ``resolve_target_link`` used to implement document links for role targets
  - ``suggest_roles`` called when generating role completion suggestions

  and are registered using the new ``Roles.add_feature()`` method. (`#495 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/495>`_)

- The ``Directives`` language feature can now be extended by registering ``DirectiveLanguageFeatures`` using the new ``add_feature`` method.
  This is now the preferred extension mechanism and should be used by all extensions going forward. (`#444 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/444>`_)
- ``DirectiveLanguageFeatures`` can now implement the following methods.

  - ``index_directives``: used to discover available directive implementations
  - ``suggest_directives``: used to determine which directive names can be suggested in the current completion context (``function`` vs ``py:function`` vs ``c:function`` etc.)
  - ``get_implementation``: used to go from a directive name (``function`` vs ``py:function``) to its implementation
  - ``suggest_options``: used to determine which directive options can be suggested in the current completion context (`#453 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/453>`_)


Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^

- ``ArgumentCompletion``, ``ArgumentDefinition`` and ``ArgumentLink`` directive providers have been deprecated in favour of ``DirectiveLanguageFeatures`` and will be removed in ``v1.0`` (`#444 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/444>`_)
- Calling the ``get_directives()`` method on the ``RstLanguageServer`` and ``SphinxLanguageServer`` objects is deprecated in favour of calling the ``get_directives()`` method on the ``Directives`` language feature.
  It will be removed in ``v1.0``

  Calling the ``get_directive_options()`` method on the ``RstLanguageServer`` and ``SphinxLanguageServer`` objects deprecated and will be removed in ``v1.0``. (`#453 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/453>`_)

     from esbonio.lsp.sphinx import SphinxLanguageServer

     def esbonio_setup(rst: SphinxLanguageServer, roles: Roles):
         ...

  This function will then only be called when the language server is actually an instance of ``SphinxLanguageServer`` and only when that lanuage server instance contains an intance of the ``Roles`` feature. (`#410 <https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/issues/410>`_)


Deprecated
^^^^^^^^^^
