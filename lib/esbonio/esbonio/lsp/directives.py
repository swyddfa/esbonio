        """Convert an rst directive to its CompletionItem representation.

        Previously, it was fine to pre-convert directives into their completion item
        representation during the :meth:`discover` phase. However a number of factors
        combined to force this to be something we have to compute specifically for each
        completion site.

        It all stems from directives that live under a namespaced domain e.g.
        ``.. c:macro::``. First in order to get trigger character completions for
        directives, we need to allow users to start typing the directive name
        immediately after the second dot and have the CompletionItem insert the leading
        space. Which is exactly what we used to do, setting
        ``insert_text=" directive::"`` and we were done.

        However with domain support, we introduced the possibility of a ``:`` character
        in the name of a directive. You can imagine a scenario where a user types in a
        domain namespace, say ``py:`` in order to filter down the list of options to
        directives that belong to that namespace. With ``:`` being a trigger character
        for role completions and the like, this would cause editors like VSCode to issue
        a new completion request ignoring the old one.

        That isn't necessarily the end of the world, but with CompletionItems assuming
        that they were following the ``..`` characters, the ``insert_text`` was no
        longer correct leading to broken completions like ``..py: py:function::``.

        In order to handle the two scenarios, conceptually the easiest approach is to
        switch to using a ``text_edit`` and replace the entire line with the correct
        text. Unfortunately in practice this was rather fiddly.

        Upon first setting the ``text_edit`` field VSCode suddenly stopped presenting
        any options! After much debugging, head scratching and searching, I eventually
        found a `couple <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/38982>`_ of
        `issues <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/41208>`_ that hinted as to
        what was happening.

        I **think** what happens is that since the ``range`` of the text edit extends
        back to the start of the line VSCode considers the entire line to be the filter
        for the CompletionItems so it's looking to select items that start with ``..``
        - which is none of them!

        To work around this, we additionaly need to set the ``filter_text`` field so
        that VSCode computes matches against that instead of the label. Then in order
        for the items to be shown the value of that field needs to be ``..my:directive``
        so it corresponds with what the user has actually written.

        Parameters

        name:
           The name of the directive as a user would type in an reStructuredText
