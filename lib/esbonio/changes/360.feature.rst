The language server now supports many (but not all) ``sphinx-build`` command line options.
The ``sphinx.*`` section of the server's initialization options has been extened to include the following options.

- ``configOverrides``
- ``doctreeDir``
- ``keepGoing``
- ``makeMode``
- ``quiet``
- ``silent``
- ``tags``
- ``verbosity``
- ``warningIsError``

See the `documentation <https://swyddfa.github.io/esbonio/docs/latest/en/lsp/getting-started.html#configuration>`_ for details.

Additionally, a new cli application ``esbonio-sphinx`` is now available which language clients (or users) can use to convert ``sphinx-build`` cli options to/from the server's initialization options.
