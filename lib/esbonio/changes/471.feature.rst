Add new ``server.completion.preferredInsertBehavior`` option.
This allows the user to indicate to the server how they would prefer completions to behave when accepted.

The default value is ``replace`` and corresponds to the server's current behavior where completions replace existing text.
In this mode the server will set the ``textEdit`` field of a ``CompletionItem``.

This release also introduces a new mode ``insert``, where completions will append to existing text rather than replacing it.
This also means that only the completions that are compatible with any existing text will be returned.
In this mode the server will set the ``insertText`` field of a ``CompletionItem`` which should work better with editors that do no support ``textEdits``.

**Note:** This option is only a hint and the server will not ensure that it is followed, though it is planned for all first party completion suggestions to (eventually) respect this setting.
As of this release, all completion suggestions support ``replace``  and role, directive and directive option completions support ``insert``.
